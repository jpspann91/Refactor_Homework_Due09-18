            <img src="./assets/images/search-engine-optimization.jpg" class="float-left" alt="picture of a planner and pencils"/>
            <h2>Search Engine Optimization</h2>
            <p>
                The dominance of mobile internet use means that users are searching for the right business as they travel, shop, 
                or sit on their couch at home. Search Engine Optimization (SEO) allows you to increase your visibility and find 
                the right customers for your business.

            <img src="./assets/images/online-reputation-management.jpg" class="float-right" alt="picture of laptop with reputation power point slide"/>
            <h2>Online Reputation Management</h2>
            <p>
                The web is full of opinions, and some of these can be negative. Social media allows anyone with an internet connection 
                to say whatever they want about your business. Online Reputation Management gives you the control over what potential 
                customers see when they search for your business.

            <h2>Social Media Marketing</h2>
            <p>
                Social media continues to have a sizable influence on buying habits. Social media marketing helps you determine which 
                platforms are suited to your brand, using analytics to find the right markets and increase your lead generation.
